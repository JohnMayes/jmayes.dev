      <section id="post_body" class="item item--contained">
        <p>
          I ran into an issue where I needed to create a CSS grid layout with a
          fixed number of columns and rows (in this case, an 8 x 8 grid), with
          the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The grid container must shrink and grow responsively.</li>
          <li>The grid container must maintain it's aspect ratio.</li>
          <li>The grid items must also shrink and grow responsively.</li>
          <li>The grid items must also maintain their own aspect ratios.</li>
          <li>
            The grid items' children (in this case, SVGs) must also shrink and
            grow responsively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The specific use case for this layout is to create a responsive
          chessboard that sizes based on the user's viewport. Here is the final
          result:
        </p>

        <p
          class="codepen"
          data-height="300"
          data-default-tab="css,result"
          data-slug-hash="zYPLLqq"
          data-preview="true"
          data-user="JohnMayes"
          style="
            height: 300px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            border: 2px solid;
            margin: 1em 0;
            padding: 1em;

          async
          src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"
        ></script>

        <p>Here is the basic CSS:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);
    width: 80vmin;
    max-width: 480px;
  } 

  .grid-item {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  }
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Here is the TLDR:</p>
        <blockquote class="smaller-text">
          We start with a grid container with 8 columns and 8 rows, each taking
          up <code>1fr</code> of space. The width of the container is
          responsively calculated based on the width of the user's viewport. The
          width of each grid item is set to <code>auto</code>, so it will expand
          to fill as much space as is available to it, in this case
          <code>1fr</code>. By using <code>aspect-ratio</code>, we calculate the
          height of the grid items based on <em>the item's own width</em>.
          Whenever the viewport changes size, the width and height of both the
          grid items and the grid container will expand and shrink responsively,
          while maintaining it's aspect ratio. By using <code>vmin</code> to
          calculate the width of the grid container, we ensure that the
          container will never grow larger than the viewport's smaller
          dimension.
        </blockquote>

        <p>And here is the long-form write up for how I got there:</p>

        <h2>The HTML</h2>
        <p>
          The actual code I am working with uses React with functional
          components to dynamically generate each square of the chessboard,
          along with is classes, which are then displayed as a grid. For the
          purposes of this demo, however, we can just use some hand-jammed HTML:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code>
  &lt;h1&gt;Chessboard&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;div class="board"&gt;
    &lt;div class="square white" id="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="square black" id="2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="square white" id="3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    ...

    &lt;div class="square white" id="64"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  </code>
        </pre>

        <p>We now have one "board" div with 64 squares as children.</p>

        <h2>The Grid Container</h2>
        <p>
          We are going to use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat</code> to
          create a grid layout of 8 columns (the width of a chessboard), with
          each column taking up <code>1fr</code> of available space. The 64 divs
          we created earlier will then fill in our gird from left to right, top
          to bottom, to from a nice 8 x 8 grid. However, the grid items are
          currently empty, so nothing will display! Let's set the height and
          width of the grid items to something arbitrary, say 40 pixels, and
          then inspect with dev tools to see our grid in action.
        </p>

        <!-- <img
          src="blog-assets/responsive-chessboard/demo-grid-columns.png"
          width="auto"
        /> -->

        <p>
          Getting somewhere. However, nothing is yet responsive. Let's change
          that.
        </p>

        <h2>The Grid Items</h2>
        <p>
          First, we are going to change the grid item's <code>height</code> and
          <code>width</code> to <code>auto</code>. This will keep each element
          the same height and width as its parent container (the grid track) —
          which is currently nothing, so again, nothing will display. In order
          to see anything rendered,
          <em>the grid container must have an explicit width.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make the grid responsive, we can set the container's width
          to a relative unit of measurement. In this case I chose
          <code>60vw</code>. Now the width of the grid container will grow and
          shrink responsively, relative to the width of the user's viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost there. However, we are still lacking an explicit height, so,
          again, nothing is being displayed (remember that so far we are only
          working with empty divs). This is where
          <code>aspect-ratio</code> comes into play. The
          <code>aspect-ratio</code> CSS property directly specifies a fixed
          width to height aspect ratio for an element. It also does not rely on
          parent size or viewport size: it relies on the element's own width or
          height. For a perfect square (what we need in this case), use
          <code>aspect-ratio: 1 / 1</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now we have a grid container with 8 columns, each taking up
          <code>1fr</code> of space. The width of the container is responsively
          calculated based on the width of the user's viewport. The width of
          each grid item is set to <code>auto</code>, so it will expand to fill
          as much space as is available to it, in this case <code>1fr</code>,
          which is again responsively calculated. Finally, by using
          <code>aspect-ratio</code>, we calculate the height of the grid items
          based on <em>it's own width</em>. Now the grid items are displayed.
          Further, whenever the viewport changes size, the width and height of
          both the grid items the the grid container will expand and shrink
          responsively, while maintaining it's aspect ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, setting the grid items to <code>display: flex</code> will set
          us up for the final "piece" of this puzzle. The chess pieces, to be
          exact.
        </p>

        <h2>The SVG elements</h2>

        <p>
          The project I am working on uses SVGs to represent chess pieces on a
          board. I need those SVGs to scale along with the chessboard! However,
          explaining SVG scaling in detail is beyond the scope of this article.
          The TLDR is that in order for an SVG element to scale proportionally
          with the size of it's parent element, while maintaining it's aspect
          ratio, the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values of the
          SVG's <code>viewBox</code> attribute need to equal the width and
          height of the coordinate system used in the SVG element itself (i.e,
          <code>viewBox="0 0 [original svg width] [original svg height]"</code
          >). Next, remove any height and width properties on the SVG element
          itself — the SVG will then scale to fill the available space in it's
          parent element, while automatically preserving it's aspect ratio.
          Nice!
        </p>

        <h2>Bonus: a little more mobile responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
          Let's change the unit of measurement used to calculate our grid width
          from <code>vw</code> to <code>vmin</code>. This ensure that the grid
          container will never grow larger than the viewport's smaller
          dimension. This means that on a mobile device the chessboard will
          always be fully visible, wether or not the device is in portrait or
          landscape mode. No media queries required.
        </p>
        <p>Again, here is the final result:</p>
